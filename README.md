Dance Evaluation and Feedback System: Leveraging Pose Estimation for Performance Analysis and Improvemen

Description:
This project aims to provide tools for pose estimation and comparison of dance movements. It includes scripts for pose estimation using MediaPipe and OpenCV, as well as a Jupyter Notebook for comparing the estimated poses with a reference.

Usage:

Run pose_est.py to perform pose estimation on your dance videos. This script utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV to extract landmark data from the videos and save it to a CSV file.

After obtaining the landmark CSV file, run pose_compare.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment. This notebook compares the estimated poses with a reference and provides analysis and visualizations of the results.
